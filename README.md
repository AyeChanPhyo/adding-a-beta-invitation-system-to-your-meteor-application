###### \#002 - Adding a Beta Invitation System to Your Meteor Application

In this recipe we'll help soon-to-be startup Urkelforce add a beta invitation system to their app. We'll create a public beta signup page, an admin page for approving and reviewing invites, and add a custom "Beta Token" field to their signup page that requests a unique code that we'll send to beta testers. We'll be relying on the React interface library, learning how to build our interface with a series of reusable components.
