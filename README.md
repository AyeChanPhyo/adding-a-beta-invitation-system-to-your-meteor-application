#### The Meteor Chef
#### \#002 - Adding a Beta Invitation System to Your Meteor Application

In this recipe we'll help soon-to-be startup Widgetly add a beta invitation system to their app. We'll create a public beta signup page, an admin page for approving invites, and add a custom "invite code" field to their signup page that requests a unique code that we'll create and send to beta testers.
